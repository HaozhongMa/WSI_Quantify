Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), which are lymphocytes located within and around cancer cells, have been recognized as significant factors associated with the progression, prognosis, and therapy of various cancers, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Concurrently, advancements in deep learning algorithms have substantially improved the effectiveness and precision of pathology image analysis. We conducted a search on Google Scholar using the terms ("machine learning" OR "artificial intelligence") AND "pancreatic cancer" AND "lymphocyte to tumor ratio", but no relevant literature was found. There is a pressing need for a fully automated model to evaluate the lymphocyte to tumor area ratio(LTR) in whole slide images (WSI) for clinical practice. Therefore,We developed a deep learning model for the comprehensive automated evaluation of LTR in HE-stained WSI, and validated its prognostic value in patient populations with PDAC.
